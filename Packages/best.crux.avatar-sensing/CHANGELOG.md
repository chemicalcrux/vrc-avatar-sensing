and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- Allow use of VRCSDK 3.10.x

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- Contact-based footstep detection

### Changed

- FootstepSensorDefinition now tells you how many physbones/contact receivers it's going to add

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- A preview of the parameters that will be generated by a FootstepSensorDefinition
- An option to create a floor collider for a footstep sensor

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replace List with DecoratedList in FootstepSensorDataV1
  - This allows tooltips to be attached
  - Again, migrating to V2 is not really necessary yet
- Creating a menu for the footstep sensor is now optional
- If an identifier is not provided, footstep targets now default to the name of the transform

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-21

### Changed

- Renamed "angleHysteresis" to "margin", since that makes a lot more sense
  - This is a breaking change, but it doesn't really matter right now.
  - A 1.x.y release would migrate to FootstepSensorDataV2 to prevent breakage.

### Fixed

- Footsteps no longer trigger instantly upon loading in
  - A two-frame delay gives the physbones enough time to activate

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-20

### Added

- A menu for footstep settings
- Hysteresis for the footstep angle
  - This prevents "flapping" by requiring the foot to go *beyond* the half-way point to trigger down/up events

### Changed

- Footstep transitions now have names
- Footstep physbones no longer collide with anything but the floor collider
- Footstep physbones now don't point precisely downwards
  - This makes them interact better with the floor collider

### Fixed

- Footstep sensors were off by default and had no controls to turn them on

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- RotationSensorDefinition, which measures how quickly single bones are rotating.
- FootstepSensorDefinition, which can detect foot down/up events, as well as measure ground proximity.
- All of these can be used:
  - Standalone, providing a globally-visible parameter
  - In a ProceduralController
